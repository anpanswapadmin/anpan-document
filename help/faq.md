## How can I stake ANPAN?

You can stake your ANPAN in AnpanSwap Honey Pools. Visit the [Honey Pools page](https://anpanswap.finance/pools).

Read our [How to Stake in Honey Pools guide](https://docs.anpanswap.finance/#/products/honey-pool/honey-pool-guide) if you'd like a hand getting started with staking.

## What is the difference between staking and farming?

Staking in Honey Pools and farming with Yield Farming are both ways to earn more ANPAN by supporting AnpanSwap.

Staking only needs some ANPAN to be added to a Honey Pool to earn ANPAN or other tokens.  
[Learn more about Honey Pool staking.](https://docs.anpanswap.finance/#/products/honey-pool/stake)

Farming is more complicated and needs LP Tokens to earn ANPAN.

Whenever there is an official airdrop on AnpanSwap it will be announced along with the requirements.

Please remember anyone can airdrop tokens to AnpanSwap users since every transaction is public on BscScan. Be sure to do your own research when it comes to non-official airdrops. To protect your funds, we recommend you don't use a smart contract you don't understand from a source you don't trust.

## Why does it say I have no BNB balance?

If you've already [transferred BNB into your Binance Smart Chain-enabled wallet](https://docs.anpanswap.finance/#/get-started/bep20-guide) but still have this error, you're most likely not [connected to Binance Smart Chain](https://docs.anpanswap.finance/#/get-started/connection-guide) within your wallet. Check your wallet's selected network and make sure you have Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\) selected.

## Is AnpanSwap protected from flashloan attacks?

AnpanSwap's vault has anti-flashloan protection. AnpanSwap’s ANPAN token isn’t vulnerable to flash loan attacks. Unlike vulnerable tokens, ANPAN token minting is predefined, and can’t be adjusted in a single transaction. Ownership cannot be transferred outside of MasterChef contract.

AnpanSwap’s other smart contracts, like AutoPool, are protected as well; they prevent other contracts from interacting with them, reducing the scope of vector attacks.
