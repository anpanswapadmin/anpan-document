# Create a Wallet

![](img-wallet-2021-09-06-23-20-09.png)

To get started on AnpanSwap, the first thing you'll need is to set up a wallet that supports Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\). Wallets are available both on desktop computers and on smartphone devices. You'll need to choose the wallet that fits your needs best.

**When you're setting up a wallet, be sure to:**

* ‚úÖ **Download and install only the latest version from an official source.**
* ‚úÖ **Follow the setup guide carefully.**
* ‚úÖ **Safely back up your recovery phrases.**
* ‚ùå **NEVER share your recovery phrases with anyone, under any circumstances.**
* ‚ùå **NEVER input your recovery phrase to a website or app, other than your wallet app.**

## Smartphone/Mobile or Desktop wallet?

Mobile device wallets and desktop-based wallets have different strengths and weaknesses. Consider which fits your needs better to help decide which type of wallet to use.

|  | Mobile | Desktop |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Use anywhere | ‚úÖ | ‚ûñ |
| Easy to use | ‚úÖ | ‚ûñ |
| More secure | ‚ûñ | ‚úÖ |
| Accessibility friendly | ‚ûñ | ‚úÖ |
| Damage/loss/theft resistant | ‚ûñ | ‚úÖ |
| Power/connection outage resistant | ‚úÖ | ‚ûñ |

## **Smartphone/Mobile wallets**

Smartphone/Mobile wallets allow you to access your crypto almost anywhere. Wallets are available on both Android and iOS devices.

1. Next, on the ‚ÄúCreate way‚Äù page, tap **Create Wallet**.

1. You‚Äôll be asked to enter a password. For your security, make sure your password is judged as ‚ÄúStrong‚Äù. You can also add a hint, but make sure it‚Äôs something only you will understand. When you‚Äôre ready, tap **Create Wallet**.

1. Tap the **Me** tab on the bottom ribbon and tap **Manage Wallets**.
