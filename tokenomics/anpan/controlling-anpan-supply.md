# Controlling ANPAN supply

![](img-anpan-2021-09-19-13-24-35.png)

## Why ANPAN has no hard cap

There's currently no hard cap on the supply of ANPAN token, making it an inflationary token. 

Community members often point to this as a cause for concern, and while the chefs certainly understand the wish for a hard cap, there's a big reason we don't expect to set one in the near future:

> ANPAN's primary function is to incentivize providing liquidity to the exchange. _Without block rewards, there would be much less incentive to provide liquidity \(LP fees etc. would remain\)._

**So what are the other ways ANPAN's supply is limited, to counter inflation?** 

## How ANPAN supply is reduced without a hard cap

The chefs aim to **making deflation higher than emission** by building deflationary mechanisms into Anpanswap's products (coming soon). The goal is for more ANPAN to leave circulation than the amount of ANPAN that's produced.

### Deflationary mechanisms

Regular token burns \([view burn address](https://bscscan.com/token/0xfeca27a665dae2cd212a251a1fa7aa8037495b20?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)\) are planned such as reducing 1 Anpan/block per month through Burn Farm (the burning process is currently manual), or a 10% burn of ANPAN spent on lottery tickets (coming soon).
