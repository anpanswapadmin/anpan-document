# HONEY Pool

**Imagine:**

1. You STAKE your ANPAN to get HONEY
2. Now you are earning a portion of 25% of each block reward
3. Now you stake that HONEY and start earning tokens from brand new BSC projects

This is galaxy mega brain ANPAN compounding.

Your ANPAN is now pulling in **multiple** income streams.

Sounds‚Ä¶ ‚Äúsweet‚Äù, right? üòè

**HONEY Pool: where sweet, new tokens meet the AnpanSwap community!**

Honey Pool allows Binance Smart Chain projects to bootstrap adoption by distributing a portion of their tokens to HONEY token holders.

Honey Pool will be split into two sections: Core and Community.

* Core will be initially selected by the AnpanSwap team.
* Community will be projects that pass a community vote on the governance portal.

Note that any project will be able to distribute tokens via Honey Pool but only projects that win a vote would be listed on the swap interface as a default option \(in order to discourage scams\).

**Why would projects want to participate?**

Since AnpanSwap has had the [fairest launch ever](https://medium.com/@anpanswap/the-fairest-launch-ever-5b246644ba2a), HONEY Pool projects will allow projects to receive market attention by issuing tokens to the largest \(and most active\) BSC community.

Projects will also receive an immediate default listing on the AnpanSwap interface, obtaining priority promotion on the exchange \(by ranking temporarily first in selecting tokens on the website\).

**Extending the utility of HONEY tokens**

Governance, collecting fees, stacking ANPAN block rewards and the \(upcoming\) Golden Honey lottery are some of the HONEY token‚Äôs core utility functions‚Ä¶ for now.

With HONEY Pool, a new function has been offered for HONEY holders in AnpanSwap: adding the toppings to $HONEY and the $ANPAN.
