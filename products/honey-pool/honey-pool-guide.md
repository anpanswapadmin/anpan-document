Staking in [Honey Pools](https://docs.anpanswap.finance/#/products/honey-pool/stake) lets you earn ANPAN or other tokens while you sleep!

It's simpler than farming with AnpanSwap's Yield Farms, because unlike the Farms, you only need to stake **one token** to start earning: usually ANPAN.

## **Getting started with Honey Pool staking**

1. Go to the Pools page [here](https://anpanswap.finance/pools).

**Manual ANPAN Pool** let you stake your ANPAN to earn ANPAN. You’ll need to harvest and compound your earnings manually.

**Other Honey Pools** let you stake your ANPAN to earn other cool tokens. Make sure you check them out.

### **Adding and removing ANPAN from a pool** 

You can easily add more ANPAN to a Honey Pool, or move some ANPAN to a more profitable pool. Here’s how you can move your staked ANPAN.

1. Click the **-** to take some ANPAN out of a pool, or the **+** to add more to the pool.
